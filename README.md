# SFML-project
A project using sfml (and a bit of Python) to develop a 2D game in C++.

## Python Dependencies
* Pytmx

## Compilation
Just run *make* in the repo's root directory.

Is done through a python script which will take a given tmx file
and convert it to a folder. In the folder there will be two files.
One is a new .tmx file which contains all the texture data and the
other contains the object data which kan then be interpreted by the
game.
